  # Because this is server configuration we should disable fetch-registry, and register-with-eureka
  # fetch-registry  controls whether or not this client is going to try to connect to the Eureka server(s) in order to download the information on other services' endpoint.
  # register-with-eureka this configuration is used to prevent Eureka server from registering itself in the server upon startup.
